# 🎬 Movies App

**Movies App** is a modern web application for searching and discovering movies, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Appwrite**.  
This project demonstrates strong skills in third-party API integration, frontend performance optimization, and backend-driven analytics.

## 🎥 Demo
- 🔗 Live demo: [Movies_App](https://stan4real.github.io/movies-app/)

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 **Movie Search with Debounce**  
  Real-time movie search powered by the **TMDb API**.  
  A debounced input (500ms) is used to reduce unnecessary network requests and improve performance and user experience.

- 📈 **Trending Movies Based on Real User Demand**  
  The app uses **Appwrite** as a custom backend database to store and track how often users search for the same queries.  
  Based on this data, the application dynamically builds a **Top 5 Trending Movies** list, reflecting real user interest rather than static popularity.

- 🖌️ **Modern & Responsive UI**  
  Styled with **TailwindCSS**, using `@apply` and `@layer` for clean, maintainable, and scalable styling architecture.

- ⚙️ **Modern Tech Stack**
  - 🧩 **React + TypeScript** — scalable and type-safe UI development  
  - ⚡ **Vite** — fast development server and optimized build  
  - 🗄️ **Appwrite** — backend-as-a-service for data storage and analytics  
  - 🎞️ **TMDb API** — movie data provider  

## 🧠 Technical Implementation

1. 🕒 **Debounced Search Logic**  
   User input is debounced before triggering API requests, ensuring efficient data fetching and reduced API load.

2. 🧮 **Search Analytics with Appwrite**  
   - Each unique search query is stored in the database.  
   - If the query already exists, its search count is incremented.  
   - If it does not exist, a new record is created with movie metadata.

3. 🏆 **Trending Movies Algorithm**  
   Movies are sorted by the number of search queries and the top 5 results are displayed as **Trending Movies**, highlighting actual user demand.
